          Most AI projects stall because nobody owns the unglamorous part — the
          connectors, the edge cases, the handoff back to a human. I own that
          part.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have shipped sales agents, procurement systems, fleet operations,
          patient software, and predictive models. The demo is never the hard
          bit. Getting the system into the daily work — where people trust it
          and keep using it — is the job, and that is what I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also teach AI — showing engineers and teams how these systems ship
          into real work, not just how to call an API. I work in French,
          Arabic, and English, and I am available now for project work and
          contract AI engineering.
